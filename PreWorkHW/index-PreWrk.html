    <p>Humbly a musician without an instrument, I am a poet, a gamer, and a dreamer, residing in New York City and raised in the Bronx. Educated beyond the classroom, my experiences shaped me to become a lover of knowlege and truths, all while remembering the importance of art in all of its forms. I believe the tech world is the latest instrument of communication and art and wish to hone my skills in this new field.</p>

    <p>Here are a few recent interests in the tech industry that I enjoy learning more about/partake in:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Software Development for Next Gen gaming</li>
      <li>current gen consoles and controllers</li>
      <li>computer graphics</li>
      <li>"Souls-era" RPGs</li>
      <li>Interactive Storytelling</li>
    </ol>
